# Pomodoro Dash Button

CMSC389L Final Project

## Overview

The Pomodoro dash button allows a user to use an [Amazon Dash Button](https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/) to easily adhere to the Pomodoro Study technique.  The Pomodoro study technique follows cycles of 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest, with a longer 10-15 minute break after 3-4 cycles.  The user simply pushes the dash button with a single, double, or long click in order to do a 25 minute work session, short break, or long break respectively.  The user will recieve a text message after the period of time is up, notifying them to proceed to the next stage.
